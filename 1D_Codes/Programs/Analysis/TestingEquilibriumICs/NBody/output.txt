Choose a (non-dimensional) box length:

Choose percentage (as a decimal) of FDM (by mass)
Fraction of Particles (by mass) = 1.0


How many particles?
Num_stars = 10000
sigma = 0.0001
Num_Bosons = 0.0

Do you want a fixed potetial (phi = 0.5*sigma*(2z/L)**2 - 1)? Choose [y/n]
n

Isolated [1] or Periodic [2] boundary conditions?

Do you want the full simulation [1] or snapshots [2]? Choose [1/2]

How long to run for? Enter Integer for number of collapse times:
Will run for 3 collapse times

Initial Conditions: Gaussian, Sine^2, or Spitzer? Enter [1,2,or 3]:
---Creating Initial Conditions---

Variable Star Masses [y/n]? (Split in two)

Choose a (non-dimensional) box length:

Choose percentage (as a decimal) of FDM (by mass)
Fraction of Particles (by mass) = 1.0


How many particles?
Num_stars = 50000
sigma = 2e-05
Num_Bosons = 0.0

Do you want the full simulation [1] or snapshots [2]? Choose [1/2]

Calculating and Plotting...
Choose the standard deviation of the initial FDM distribution (as a fraction of the box width):
integral of |chi|^2 : 0.0
Numerically calculated integral of |psi|^2 : 0.0
Choose the standard deviation of the Particle system (as fraction of the box width):
v_min = -1569.225530468137, v_max = 1566.0870794072007

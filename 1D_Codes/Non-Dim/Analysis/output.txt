Time scale T = 1.0
Mass scale M = 1

Choose a (non-dimensional) box length:

Choose percentage (as a decimal) of FDM (by mass)
Fraction of Particles (by mass) = 1.0


How many particles?
Num_stars = 100000
sigma = 1e-05
Num_Bosons = 0.0
mu = 1

Do you want a fixed potetial (phi = 0.5*sigma*(2z/L)**2 - 1)? Choose [y/n]

Do you want the full simulation [1] or snapshots [2]? Choose [1/2]

Calculating and Plotting...
integral of |chi|^2 : 0.0
Numerically calculated integral of |psi|^2 : 0.0
Choose the standard deviation of the Particle system (as fraction of the box width):

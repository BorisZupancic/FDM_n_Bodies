Choose a FDM fuzziness:
Fuzziness: r = 5.0
Mass mu = 0.1, m = mu*M = 0.1

Choose percentage (as a decimal) of FDM (by mass)

=> Num_Bosons = 100000

Do you want the full simulation [1] or snapshots [2]? Choose [1/2]

Calculating and Plotting...
Choose the standard deviation of the initial FDM distribution (as a fraction of the box width):
integral of |chi|^2 : 9999.994414547742
Numerically calculated integral of |psi|^2 : 99999.94414547742
Choose the standard deviation of the Particle system (as fraction of the box width):

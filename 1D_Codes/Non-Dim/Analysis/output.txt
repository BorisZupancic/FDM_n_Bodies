Time scale T = 1.0
Mass scale M = 1

Choose a (non-dimensional) box length:


Choose your particle/star mass (per unit area):
How many particles?
Choose a FDM fuzziness:
Fuzziness: r = 0.5
Mass mu = 1.0, m = mu*M = 1.0

Choose percentage (as a decimal) of FDM (by mass)

=> Num_Bosons = 0

Do you want the full simulation [1] or snapshots [2]? Choose [1/2]

Calculating and Plotting...
Choose the standard deviation of the initial FDM distribution (as a fraction of the box width):
integral of |chi|^2 : 0.0
Numerically calculated integral of |psi|^2 : 0.0
Choose the standard deviation of the Particle system (as fraction of the box width):

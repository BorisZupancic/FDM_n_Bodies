# Testing the Full System Simulation

All tests are completed with 10000 Bosons (Normalization of FDM wavefunction), 10000 Particles/Stars. The width of the box is taken to be L = 2. The mass of particles/stars is m = 1 in all cases. The initial density distributions of both the FDM and Particles is taken to be 0.1*L (1 tenth of box width).

The only variable that we will change is the FDM Boson Mass (i.e fuzziness). Simulations run through `ProgramTesting.py`

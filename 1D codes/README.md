#1D codes

My collection of 1D codes. 

"Non-Dim" currently contains the most complete and relevant Notebooks and scripts. 
This is where I am currently working on developing a program that can run FDM and Particle simulation simultaneously,
and self-consistently.

"Old Clutter" is a folder that contains exclusively files from early development. Keeping this for possible future reference.
Many of these Jupyter Notebooks will not work unless I go in and update some tedious bits of information like Directories 
for importing modules and exporting images and videos.

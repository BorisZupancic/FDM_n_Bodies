# FDM_n_Bodies
My packages for simulating Fuzzy Dark Matter and Particles in a self-consistent gravitational field. Currently only in 1-dimension.

`Program.py` is the main script that can run a simulation. 

`OneD` is the package containing all modules and functions used in `Program.py`.

The folder `GUI` is currently an experiment.
